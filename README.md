This application has been built as a recruitemt task. Thanks to @Agnieszka Dombrowska: patient and awesome recruiter for motivating me to complete it despite my personal problems and SEVERE lack of time.

### Application

This app was supposed to be sleek and fast responsible solution to using indexedDB. It runs well, fast and looks good on variety of devices.
It is made to convince YOU to give me a chance as professional developer. My REACT learning speed is lighting fast, just give me a freaking CHANCE.

### TODO
 - [x]Create a fully functionning solution,
 - [ ] Fix naming conventions,
 - [ ] Handle blobbing errors,
 - [ ] Ensure database functionality with multiple users acesssing the base in different time.
 - [ ] Relatively low complexity of state management does not warrant usage of Redux, yet I might give it a go to show capabillity in doing so.
 - [ ] Favicon. Come on, really  that's low priority task will you persecute me becuase of IT?


### SPECIAL THANKS

As usual: Create-React-App: an awesome library that provides webpack-babel functionality for you: go develop freestyle React instead of ploughing through npm:-)
Thanks guys.
